# KeyCertExtractor
A hacked together GUI tool for extracting a cert file and private key from a given SSL .pfx file. The application takes a locally existing .pfx file or .p12 file and, using the /usr/bin/openssl command, will extract the private key and PEM certificate for you as long as you know the passphrase.
